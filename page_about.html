            Who am I?
            <br>
            My name is Cahid Arda. I am a undergraduate computer science student currently in Bogazici University, Turkey.

            What are my plans for future as a computer science student?
            <br>
            I have yet to decide what I will exactly be doing in the future professionally. There are so many possibilities; Web design, game development, data science, artifical intelligence, quantum computers and son on... I don't have enough knowledge about every single field of study to decide what I will work on.
            <br>
            One of the reasons why I have decided to learn web development in order to create myself a website was to learn about web development. This way, I would have a rough idea of how things are.

            What are my interests?
            <br>
            I am interested in stuff related to technology and science in general. I try my best to keep up with latest developments reading articles every now and then.
            <br>
            I like reading on economics, psychology and history (especially war history) as a hobby.
