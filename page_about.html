        What are my plans for future as a computer science student?
        <br>
        I have yet to decide what I will exactly be doing in the future professionally. There are so many possibilities; web design, game development, data science, artifical intelligence, quantum computers and son on... I don't have enough knowledge about every single field of study to decide what I will work on.
        <br>
        One of the reasons why I started my own blog was tolearn about web development. This way, I would have a rough idea of how things are.

        What are my interests?
        <br>
        I am interested in stuff related to technology and science in general. I try my best to keep up with latest developments reading articles every now and then.
        <br>
        I like reading on economics, psychology and history (especially war history) as a hobby.
